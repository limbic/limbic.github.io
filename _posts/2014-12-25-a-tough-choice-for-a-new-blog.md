This Christmas I decided to move on from http://www.limbicnutrition.com/blog/ . 

The old horse has had a good run, 15 years, which in blog years it ancient. 

But what to move to? 

## Domain Name

I have quite a few tp choose from:

### jonathandavis.co.uk / jonathandavis.org

Using your own name for your blog is a little bit weird. This domain is also very long looking. Long and thin, whereas I am more...err...stout.

### jondavis.info 

This is better. Short. The .info is a a bit weird though. 

### Consoliant.com
